# Solana Gasless Research

Tools to calculate stats about wallets with no SOL

----

Sometimes, a friend sends you some USDC for you to experiment with crypto.
Usually, you can't start transacting with it right away: you need native token of the network.
You can't exchange USDC to SOL on a DEX or move it to another wallet â€” either of these transactions requires SOL.

[Octane](https://github.com/solana-labs/octane) gasless relayer solves this problem. It allows to pay for transaction
fees in SOL and execute swaps of tokens to SOL without having any SOL.

This repo aggregates tools for research about the tokens-with-no-SOL problem. How common are transfers to wallets without SOL?
How many users Octane integration to a wallet will impact? Which SPL tokens should Octane accept?
